# CORE SESSION MASTER
> Last updated: 2026-03-14 | Owner: REINVAGNAR | Version: CORE v6.0

## Current Step: Task 8 — synthesize_evolutions (8.4 test, 8.5 docs) — ready to run live test next session

## last_good_commit: 2026-03-14 (post Task 7 — all 50 tools verified green)
> If Railway goes down: use `github:get_file_contents` to read this SHA, restore via `github:push_files`. Do NOT use core-agi: tools when Railway is confirmed down — they all fail simultaneously.

---

## 1. SESSION START CHECKLIST

**Claude Desktop:**
1. Call `core-agi:session_start` → bootstraps health + counts + last session + mistakes + evolutions
2. Read this file if task registry context needed
3. Check `get_mistakes(domain=X)` before any write in that domain

**claude.ai / mobile:**
1. `web_fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pockiesaints7/core-agi/main/SESSION.md`
2. Use `POST /patch` for any source file edits (never gh_search_replace from web)
3. Use `github:*` tools for all other file reads/writes

---

## 2. WHAT IS CORE

CORE v6.0 is a Recursive Self-Improvement AGI running 24/7 on Railway.
It learns from every session via a hot→cold reflection pipeline, distills patterns, and evolves its own behavior.
Operated via Claude Desktop (MCP direct, 50 tools), claude.ai (web/mobile), and Telegram (@reinvagnarbot).
Full self-knowledge: see `CORE_SELF.md`. Full tool rules: see `operating_context.json`.
Architecture: split into core_main.py, core_tools.py, core_train.py, core_github.py, core_config.py.

---

## 3. CURRENT SOP

```
plan → execute → log → reflect → stop
```

- **1 task at a time.** Finish, log, reflect, then move to next.
- **Read before write.** Always. No exceptions.
- **Check mistakes** (domain=X) before any write in that domain.
- **End every Desktop session** with `session_end` tool.
- **Stop at 90% context** → call session_end, standby for next session.
- **When in doubt, do less and ask.**
- **SESSION.md is the single source of truth for all tasks.** When a task item is done, tick it here immediately. No other file tracks task status.

---

## 4. AUTONOMOUS MODE PROTOCOL

When user says "activate autonomous mode":
1. Launch daemon: `C:\Python314\python.exe "C:\Users\rnvgg\.claude-skills\selfchat\core_selfchat.py" --mode watch`
2. Write seed prompt to `C:\Users\rnvgg\.claude-skills\selfchat\prompt.txt`
3. Daemon sends prompt when Claude goes idle (polls for "Stop response" button absence)
   - Before every send: scroll to bottom (click 744,500 → End key → click 979,867) — Claude Desktop does NOT auto-scroll
4. Claude responds → **IMMEDIATELY write next prompt to prompt.txt** ← CRITICAL, loop dies without this
5. Repeat until task complete or user says stop
6. Stop: write `stop` to `status.txt`

---

## 5. ACTIVE RULES

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| `read_file` / `write_file` | OMIT `repo` arg — defaults to pockiesaints7/core-agi |
| `sb_query` | Use `filters` param, NOT `query_string` |
| Source file edits | NEVER hardcode filenames — fetch live from `session_start → architecture.entry_point` |
| Editing source from Desktop | `gh_search_replace` (small) or `github:push_files` (full restore) |
| Editing source from claude.ai | `POST /patch` ONLY |
| `processed_by_cold` | Use `eq.0` / `eq.1` (integer), NOT `eq.true` / `eq.false` |
| Structural change | Update CORE_SELF.md FIRST, then operating_context.json, then KB |
| Session end | Always call `session_end` — logs session + hot_reflection in one call |
| Task done | Tick checkbox in SESSION.md immediately + write result to backlog_update() |
| evolution_queue | Only `knowledge`, `code`, `config` change_types allowed — never `backlog` |
| Railway recovery | If Railway down: read last_good_commit above → restore via github: tools. Never retry core-agi: tools when Railway is confirmed down. |

### TASK 8 — synthesize_evolutions: Claude as CORE Architect (Prereq: Task 3)
> Design finalized 2026-03-14. Claude reads ALL pending evolution_queue entries and thinks as an unconstrained architect — inventing new tools, tables, architecture changes, logic fixes, or entirely new concepts CORE does not know it needs yet. Output is a structured engineering blueprint appended to SESSION.md as a new task chain.

**Why Claude not Groq:** Groq extracts isolated patterns. Claude sees the whole picture, reasons across all signals simultaneously, and can invent what is unthinkable from individual patterns alone.

**What it reads:**
- All evolution_queue where status = pending
- All pattern_frequency high-frequency entries
- Recent cold_reflections (dominant themes)
- Recent gaps_identified from hot_reflections
- Current SESSION.md (existing task context)

**What Claude produces:**
A structured blueprint with concrete task chains — new tools, new tables, architecture changes, logic fixes, wild ideas. Each item tagged: impact (HIGH/MED/LOW), effort (HIGH/MED/LOW), category (new_tool / new_table / architecture / logic_change / wild).

**Relationship with approve/reject — NOT a replacement:**
synthesize_evolutions is the PLANNING GATE before approve/reject, not a substitute.
Workflow: synthesize first (understand big picture + get blueprint) → then bulk approve/reject informed.
Approve still needed: lands Groq KB entries into knowledge_base permanently.
Reject still needed: discards noise. synthesize only produces SESSION.md task chain.

**Evolution status after synthesis:** marked synthesized — acknowledged, not yet approved or rejected.
**Trigger:** Manual only — owner calls it when ready for a planning session.

- [x] 8.1 Add t_synthesize_evolutions() to core_tools.py — fetches all data, assembles full context payload, returns to Claude for unconstrained reasoning
- [x] 8.2 Register in TOOLS dict with architect-level prompt: no constraints, invent freely, think 6 months ahead
- [ ] 8.3 Add status=synthesized handling in evolution_queue flow
- [ ] 8.4 Test: call tool, verify Claude produces blueprint with impact/effort matrix + wild ideas section
- [ ] 8.5 Update CORE_SELF.md + operating_context.json
